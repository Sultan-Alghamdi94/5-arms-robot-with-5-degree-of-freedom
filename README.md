# arms-robot-with-5-degree-of-freedom

Introduction:

This project showcases a robotic arm with five motors, providing it with five degrees of freedom (DOF). Such an arm is commonly used in various industrial applications, including assembly, welding, material handling, and precise manipulation tasks. The design and functionality of the arm allow for a wide range of movements, making it a versatile tool in automated systems.

Description

The robotic arm depicted in the image consists of multiple segments connected by joints, each powered by an individual motor. Here's a detailed breakdown of its components and capabilities:

Base Motor: The arm is mounted on a base that houses the first motor, enabling the entire structure to rotate horizontally. This motor provides the first degree of freedom, allowing the arm to swivel left and right.
Shoulder Joint: Attached to the base is the shoulder joint, powered by the second motor. This joint allows for vertical movement, enabling the arm to lift and lower its entire length. This movement constitutes the second degree of freedom.
Elbow Joint: Further along the arm is the elbow joint, driven by the third motor. This joint facilitates bending and straightening motions, providing the third degree of freedom. It allows the arm to reach forward and retract.
Wrist Joint: The fourth motor is located at the wrist joint. This joint enables the rotation of the end of the arm, adding the fourth degree of freedom. It provides the ability to twist and turn the end effector attached to the arm.
End Effector (Gripper): Finally, the fifth motor controls the end effector, often a gripper or tool. This motor allows for precise movements and manipulations, providing the fifth degree of freedom. The gripper can open and close, allowing the arm to grasp and release objects.
